For this assignment I chose to serialize the data using JSON,
with the help of the json-simple library. Instead of serializing
tests and surveys into their own files, they're serialized into
repositories containing other surveys and tests.

I've included two repositories here, foo.json, and bar.json.

foo.json contains one test named "Foobar!", and a survey named
"Rick and Morty".

bar.json contains one survey named "CS350".

Not all methods are given docstrings since they are already
documented in the abstract class they inherit from. This is the
case with most Question subclasses, except for the MultipleChoice
class.

The driver code is largely in the Repository class, with the prompts
for all Questions in the Question class and subclasses.
